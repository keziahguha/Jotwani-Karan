What does it say to you? How do you behave with it? Or are you still finding it? I ask myself these questions, because I haven't found mine, yeah that passion.. What could I poasibly get up and want to do at 3am? Oh yeah there was tennis, but life smashed the racket on me.. It's great not finding your passion, it's magnificent knowing morning in life, but it's also good to do what you like doing, and if you love it. Hey there's your passion! There's a reason why we all don't know what we want to achieve in life, it's the same question. Where's my passion? Don't try to hard to find it, it will come to you someday, and If it doesn't, do whatever you feel like, just like you were before reading this piece today.. </p>
