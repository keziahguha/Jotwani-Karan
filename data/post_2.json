  "content":            "<p>Time and tide, they waited for no man, but ironic that we do right? We wait for that tide when we sit by the sea, and for a time that would bring in that wave of glee.. Crazy is the mind, the mind is everywhere, everywhere you see people, people are crazy, so not rare.. The early morning face and the face before you sleep, do you see a difference between them? They speak about your day that's been dirty or neat.. Some fake that face, some genuinely smile, some cry without any reason, some feel misery is by their side.. Reality, are you afraid of it? Don't be, it makes you who you are.. Face the downfall, face the downpour, stand in that rain, drench it out like never before.. Cry and laugh everyday, you can't be static all your life, be like the night and day.. Just be.. </p>"
