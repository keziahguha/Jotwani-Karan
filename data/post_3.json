  "content":            "<p>Script in front, the camera behind, this life of action, short lived and how.. How you masquerade from yourself to another, you have so many people inside you, doesn't it bother?.. Astonishing acts, some bitter, some butter, some sweet, some neat.. Like an owl one has to feel the space around, think 360, cry and laugh out loud.. But I'm cheating you, and I get paid for it, but I also try to be myself, that's where you like me in it.. An actor does what he has to, and he takes you into a world that never exists, and you live the life that you saw through.. The cup of lemon tea lies untouched, insee the vapours rising up, rising up.. As I put that mask on and leave for a take, il brb, to who I am, till then, I'm liar, being real while I fake ;)</p>"
