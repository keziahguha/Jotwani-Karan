  "content":            "<p>The marble floor shining like it does, the ceiling glaring down as he lay flat on his bed, both trying to find out the face behind the mask, but he gets up, those eyes, they're red.. Red with love, red with lov, red with lo, red with I.. Red .. Just red! Walking out of the door, that mask back on him, covered in that helmet, scorching the streets loud, he rides through those holes where she stood like that smiling cloud.. Stop and start, and start and stop, the order of his life, where is that knife? He finished that day, came home to face the ceiling and the marble, they saw him pull out something from his chest suddenly, that knife that killed him slowly, but it's stuck, it's stuck.. It's going back in, it wants to stay there, that ache won't ever go, it won't ever go.. An incomplete chapter with her, he feeds himself those memories, her face embedded deeper than your wound, she heals him and kills him at the same time.. That night he didn't blink at all, and the ceiling spoke to him, that lump in the throat, the ceiling cracked and a droplet fell.. It was rain trying to wipe awaken that face, but even the rain couldn't make him blink, he lay there both ceiling and marble trying to find out the face behind the mask.. Today morning he left, and that knife placed well inside, bleeding little by little, he hopes to survive.. He hopes to survive.. Scorching the streets again, he stops and stares where she stood that day, he can't see her, but he can see her.. He's changed, changed for the good, he never read a single line ever, but he read that chapter named after her, and saw life and love smile and tatter, smile and tatter.. She.. </p>
